<b> Version 1.19-41.0.6 </b></br>
<p>The entire mod has been re-written to work on both Fabric and Forge! This may mean there may be some fresh bugs to squash and I would be happy to fix them at https://github.com/Suff99/Weeping-Angels/issues</p>
<p>If you want to help with translating the mod, you can do so at https://crowdin.com/project/weeping-angels</p>

<b>Noteable changes</b>
<p>The first noticable change being that the mod is now Fabric supported! But you may also notice there is no longer a spawn item per angel variant - this is by design and not a bug. It is now similar to the vanilla behaviour of villager spawners.
You may also notice that some angel models are missing - they will be implemented with updates to come!

Chrondyne Generators are still throwable, but must be activated when they hit the ground - you can throw a activated one by having a Kontron Ingot in your offhand at the time of throwing. If you threw a un-activated generator you can activate it by right clicking with Kontron!
